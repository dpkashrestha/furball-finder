## Name

Furball Finder

## Description

Furball Finder allows users to search for a new pet in their area via: type, age, size & gender. After entering the desired information they will be shown results in their area via the Petfinder API (https://www.petfinder.com/developers/). Once results are shown, the user can select a pet and be given directions to the shelter of the selected pet via Google Maps API (https://developers.google.com/maps).

## Concept

Our motivation for this project was to make an incredibly beneficial and rewarding act, pet adoption, streamlined and accessable for anyone who would like to travel that road. Driving around to different shelters can take up alot of time and you may not even find the furry friend you were hoping for. Alternatively, searching online can be tedious as well and having to check multiple websites can be confusing and discouraging! We've done our best to aliviate that stress with a one stop web application that can provide you with filters, choices, and directions. You can spend less time searching and more time with your new best friend!

## User Story

As someone who is looking to adopt a pet, I would like to have a convenient option for finding my prefered pet, so that I can avoid the hassel of multiple websites and inconvenience of driving to different shelters to shop.
